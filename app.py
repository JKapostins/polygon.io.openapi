# This application is responsible for converting the Polygon.io API documentation to an OPEN API 3.0 specification.
# The source of the documentation is on the polygon.io website in html form.
# The application will parse the html and minimize content to only the relevant information required to generate the Open API Spec.

# 1.) Parse the html document found at https://polygon.io/docs/stocks/getting-started 

# 2.) Remove the first nav element from the document

# 3.) The Second nav element is the main navigation (side bar) which contains links and hierarchy to the various endpoints.
#     Dump this element to an html file so we can use it for hierarchy reference and then remove it from the document.

# 4.) The first div element is the main content of the page, write this to a file called body.html

# 5.) Find all the anchors in the body.html

# 6.) For each anchor, find the corresponding div element and write it to a file called {endponit_name}_endpoint.html
